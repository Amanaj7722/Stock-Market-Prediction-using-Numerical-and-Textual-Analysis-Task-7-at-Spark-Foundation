# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Numerical-and-Textual-Analysis-Task-7-at-Spark-Foundation
● Objective: Creating a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines ● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&amp;P BSE SENSEX)
● Download historical stock prices from  https://finance.yahoo.com/ ● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6 ● Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model 
I have used Auto-ARIMA model to make stock market prices predictions using the historical stock prices data. In the sentiment analysis model, I have made use of different machine learning algorithms-Random Forest Regressor, LightGBM, Adaboost and Xgboost- to make the predictions.
I have also use a tensorflow to calculate the losses.
